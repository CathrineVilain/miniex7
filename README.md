Our program consitst of various soundfiles, conditional statements and a LOT of mousepressed functions. The way the program works; If you press a key on the keyboard (it has to be a letter) an individual soundfile for that exact letter is played - the letter itself is displayed on the screen and fades into the background rather quickly. We chose the English alphabet, so we have 26 different soundfiles recorded by Nicoline and I. 

Before we had this idea we looked at different e-lit works. At first we wanted to do something with a poem. We wanted to deconstructing it by splitting the words and make the program read them in different orders. But then we thougt; "why not aim higher". So we decided to deconstruct the English language instead. Now you might think; "but you haven't deconstructed annything, you simply recorded all the different letters of the alphabet". Yes that is exactly what we did! But while making this we realized that the names of the letters in the alphabet is actually a deconstruction of the language itself. The names of the letters has no meaning at all. And if you try the program, you'll discover that it's really difficult to express yourself using just the names of the letters. We only got as far as using the sounds of some of the letters being the equivalent to words. Forexample like R and U, which resembles the words; are and you. You can construct sentences like; r u ok? and r u a dj?. This is interesting as it illustrates how important notation is to a language. We know how individual words are supposed to sound we also know how letters are pronunced individually. Therefore we can determine that the sound of certain words are compatible to the sound of certain letters. This is what makes you capable of understanding such "sentences" as the above (r u ok). As a human you posess the ability/intelligence to articulate the words/letters and presribe meaning to them. According to the text "vocable code" by Geoff Cox and Alex Mc Lean this is what separates us from machines/computers; our ability to presribe meaning to what doesn't seem to have any meaning at first glance. Like our ability to learn the grammars of different languages.  

Apart from having a deeper meaning the program is actually quite entertaining. While pressing the keys the program plays the different audiofiles. If you press different keys rapidly you can make the program sound weird. You can even attempt to make a beat if you want (why we called our program; R U A DJ?). While we as humans can find meaning in what has no meaning we can also find fun in what really has no meaning at all.
